# __Happy Dog Café - Portfolio Project 1__
This is the website for Happy Dog Café, a small independently owned dog-friendly café in Cork city. The website serves as a point for both new and existing users to find out information such as café opening times, menu, history behind the café and its owners and allows them to sign up for the café's walking club through a form on the site.

The aim of the project is to build an easily navigatable, responsive website using HTML and CSS.

- __Our Journey Timeline__
    - The timeline gives users an even deeper look into the background of the café and tells the story of how the owners set up the business. The timeline boxes appear on alternating sides of the screen on large devices and in a line on the same side of the timeline bar on smaller screens to make it easily readable.

- __Walk Club Introductory Section__
    - The user is introduced to the walk club, it informs the user of days and times of the walks, distance and lets them know of a 50% discount on their drink if they partake in the club. This section covers 66% of the screen width on large screens but expands on smaller screens to remain looking good for the user.
