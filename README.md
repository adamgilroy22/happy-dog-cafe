## Features 

### Existing Features

### Common Elements

These elements appear across every page of the website as the user navigates it.

- __Logo and Navigation Bar__
    - The logo and navigation bar appears on every page of the website. Both of these have been adapted to work on various screen sizes. The logo has a link to the homepage embedded and each of the links on the navigation menu brings the user to the correct page

- __The main image__
    - The main image appears across the site too with the text inside the box displaying what page the user is on to further allow for easy access. This image along with the text box are fully responsive and will resize in accordance with the size of the screen that the user is viewing the website on.

- __The Footer__
    - The footer displays across every page of the site and displays social media icons with links to the corresponding social media website to allow the user to stay up to date with the café on these platforms

### Homepage

This is the landing page that the user will be brought to when first entering the site

- __Information Card__
    - This card displays the café opening times, address, and contact information. The phone number and email address are both clickable to allow the user to either phone or email the café straight from the home page. The right-hand side of the card contains an image of a coffee cup with a dog on it to stick with the theme of the site. the card is adapted for smaller screens with the image appearing below the text on smaller devices.

- __Testimonials__
    - This section displays customer reviews, this is particularly useful for new users checking out the site who haven't visited the café before. This section is responsive with all 4 testimonials appearing on the same line on large screens, 2 across 2 lines on medium screens and individually on 4 lines for small screens.

### Menu Page

This is where a user can find the café's menu along with prices

- __Café Menu__
    - The menu shows the items on sale in the café along with each item's price. The menu is split into 4 sections covering hot drinks, cold drinks, food and items for your dog.

- __Menu Image__
    - Next to the café menu is an image of two people sat drinking coffee with their dog. This is responsive as on smaller screens the image appears below the menu so as that the menu doesn't appear too small to read.
